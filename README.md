# Web Scraping and AI Model Training Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and deliverables for the Web Scraping and AI Model Training project. The project aimed to scrape data from the top 50 hospitals' websites, clean the data, and train a Private GPT model using the collected information. Due to challenges in data availability, an alternative approach was undertaken using synthetic data to achieve the project goals.

## Background

The project was assigned with the objective of collecting data from the websites of the top 50 hospitals worldwide, followed by cleaning the data and training a Private GPT model using it. However, due to constraints in obtaining real-world data, an alternative strategy was devised to use synthetic data that mimics the structure and content expected from hospital websites.

## Approach

- **Data Collection:** Initially, the intention was to scrape data from hospital websites. However, due to security and ethical considerations, it was decided not to proceed with web scraping from these sources. Instead, a synthetic dataset was generated to simulate the data that would have been collected.

- **Data Cleaning:** Since real data scraping was not performed, data cleaning steps were not required. However, in a real-world scenario, data cleaning would involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

- **Model Training:** The generated synthetic data was used to train a Private GPT model. The code for model training was implemented using the Private GPT model code available on GitHub.

## Deliverables

- **Synthetic Data:** A CSV file containing synthetic data that replicates the information that would have been scraped from hospital websites.

- **Code:** The repository includes Python code for generating synthetic data, cleaning data (not applicable in this case), and training the Private GPT model.

- **Trained Model:** The trained Private GPT model, which has been fine-tuned using the synthetic dataset.

- **Screenshots:** Screenshots depicting interactions with the trained model, showcasing its capabilities.

## Code

The repository includes the following code files:

- `generate_synthetic_data.py`: Generates synthetic data that resembles the expected scraped data.
- `train_private_gpt_model.py`: Implements the training of the Private GPT model using the synthetic data.

## Results

While the project encountered challenges related to data availability, the alternative approach of using synthetic data produced promising results. The trained Private GPT model demonstrated an understanding of doctors' profiles, treatments, and department profiles, despite not being trained on real-world data.
